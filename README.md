# Tiny Suite of CLI Music Machines

This is Will Robinson of Lost in Space fame. I am working on some MIDI tools. I shall share them with you once I return back to earth.

ps. I am not making my robot write the tools. He is too busy writing my upgrade to be working on silly blip-n-bloop toys.

## Overview

It's a monorepo. All of the tools and their documentation are within. `core` is a library.
