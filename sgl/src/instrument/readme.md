# Tiny Instruments

## Overview
The idea here is that you may create instruments.

What does that mean?

Yeah, good question. They are really meta instruments that generate symbol tables so that you may generate sequences using a metaphore that is an instrument.

## Stringed Instrument
Describes symbols that reflect strings. And supports "indexing" on those strings.
